# gulp-etl-splitfile #



Split a single Message Stream file into multiple. Ideal for chunking a stream into smaller pieces for manageability of file sizes or upload runs to database

This is a **gulp-etl** plugin, and as such it is a [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) plugin. **gulp-etl** plugins processes [ndjson](http://ndjson.org/) data streams/files which we call **Message Streams** and which are compliant with the [Singer specification](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SPEC.md#output). Message Streams look like this:

```
{"type": "SCHEMA", "stream": "users", "key_properties": ["id"], "schema": {"required": ["id"], "type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "integer"}}}}
{"type": "RECORD", "stream": "users", "record": {"id": 1, "name": "Chris"}}
{"type": "RECORD", "stream": "users", "record": {"id": 2, "name": "Mike"}}
{"type": "SCHEMA", "stream": "locations", "key_properties": ["id"], "schema": {"required": ["id"], "type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "integer"}}}}
{"type": "RECORD", "stream": "locations", "record": {"id": 1, "name": "Philadelphia"}}
{"type": "STATE", "value": {"users": 2, "locations": 1}}
```

### Usage
**gulp-etl** plugins accept a configObj as its first parameter. The configObj
will contain any info the plugin needs.

This plugin will check for the following parameters in the configObj:

- `index:number` - the number of lines in each chunk



### Quick Start
* Dependencies: 
    * [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    * [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) - At least v6.3 (6.9 for Windows) required for TypeScript debugging
    * npm (installs with Node)
    * typescript - installed as a development dependency
    * serverless - `npm install -g serverless` to install globally
* Clone this repo and  run `npm install` to install npm packages
* Debug: with [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) use `Open Folder` to open the project folder, then hit F5 to debug. This runs without compiling to javascript using [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node)
* Test: `npm test` or `npm t`
* Compile to javascript: `npm run build`
* Run using included test data (be sure to build first): `gulp --gulpfile debug/gulpfile.ts`

### Testing

We are using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html) for our testing.  Each of our tests are in the `test` folder. 

- Run `npm test` to run the test suites
